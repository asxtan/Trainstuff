# CLAUDE.md — Commute Board

A static, installable PWA showing live UK train departures (time, status,
expected arrival, journey time, platform, carriages) for a commute. No backend.

## Deploy / workflow
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages at `https://asxtan.github.io/Trainstuff/`. Repo `asxtan/Trainstuff`.
- **Commit straight to `main`** — every push to `main` auto-deploys via
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. (User authorised direct-to-main; no PR needed.)
- Pages source must be "GitHub Actions" (already enabled).
- The sandbox **cannot reach `github.io`** (egress allowlist) — can't verify the
  live site here; rely on the user. `git push` works (remote is allowlisted).
- Keep chat replies concise; user prefers shorter responses.

## Data source
- Public Huxley2 instances (Darwin LDBWS proxy): `HUXLEY_BASE_URLS` in `config.js`,
  tried in order. Called directly from the browser. `apiJson()` fails over to the
  next instance on a *transport* failure only (fetch rejects — down/DNS/CORS);
  an HTTP status or bad JSON is flagged `err.reachable` and stops the walk, so a
  404 for a typo'd CRS doesn't burn through the list. The first instance that
  answers becomes `activeBase` for the session. These are community-run with no
  uptime guarantee — an outage here is the most likely cause of a blank board.
- Board: `/departures/{from}/to/{to}/{rows}?expand=true`. `expand=true` is needed
  for calling points → expected arrival + journey time. **Caveat:** if the live
  instance ignores `expand`, arrival/journey show "—" everywhere; fallback would
  be a per-service details call. Station search: `/crs/{query}` (best-effort).

## Files
- `index.html` / `app.js` / `styles.css` — the app.
- `config.js` — `HUXLEY_BASE_URL`, defaults (home ECR, work A VIC, work B LBG),
  `NUM_ROWS`, `REFRESH_MS`, `MORNING_BEFORE_HOUR`.
- `manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js` — PWA shell.
- `stations.json` — bundled station list for the picker / offline.
- `sample_board.json` — demo payload (`?demo=1`); includes calling points.
- `tools/make_icons.py` — pure-stdlib PNG generator (green train, white bg);
  outputs `icon-512/192.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`. Re-run to change the icon.

## Key behaviours / decisions
- **Stations are user-set in-app** (gear → settings), saved per device in
  localStorage. Home + Work A (required) + Work B (**optional**). A cleared B is
  stored as `""` (vs `null` = unset) so "one station" persists.
- **To work / To home toggle**, defaults by time of day (`MORNING_BEFORE_HOUR`).
  - To work, two stations: merged board of Home→A and Home→B, deduped by
    serviceID, time-sorted, each train tagged (blue = A, purple = B). One
    station: plain Home→A board.
  - To home: A|B return picker (hidden when only one work station) → origin→Home.
- **Row layout:** left column = all time info (departure big, status, then
  "→ arrival · journey"); middle = destination/tags + platform (big number);
  right = carriages chip. Order chosen so it reads chronologically when delayed.
- Auto-refresh every `REFRESH_MS`; refresh button has spinner + min-visible delay;
  "updated" stamp pulses.

## Caching gotchas (important)
- `sw.js` is **network-first** for the app shell (so deploys show immediately),
  cache only as offline fallback. Train API is cross-origin → never cached.
- **Bump `CACHE` version in `sw.js` whenever assets change**, so old caches purge.
- **Cache-bust asset URLs when replacing a file in place** (e.g. icons use
  `?v=2` in `index.html`/`manifest`/`sw.js`) — iOS Add-to-Home-Screen otherwise
  pulls a stale `apple-touch-icon`.
- iOS Home Screen icons don't update in place: user must delete + re-add.

## Security
- Render API values via `textContent` only (never `innerHTML`) — DOM-XSS guard.
  `stripTags()` removes markup with regex, not by parsing. Inline SVGs are static.

## Verify
- `node --check app.js`, validate JSON, `python3 -m http.server` + curl for 200s.
- Logic checks run in Node (no DOM); `?demo=1` renders the bundled sample.
